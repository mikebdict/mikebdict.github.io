##### Whats next?

Putting down what I'm up to for prosperity and some of the things that I hope to get onto over the coming year.

Programming wise, learning Python this year has been a blast. I guess I'm about 6 months down the line now from where I started. Although I know that I still have a long way to go with it being at a level where I can actually start to build things that I conceptualise is awesome.

I've been fiddling around with Flask a lot over the last month. I have a big data driven website that I want to build as an end goal, but for the time being I'm focusing on smaller projects that leverage the skills that I'll need for that. Fiddling around with classes, learning how to use redis and also some bits of javascript for the front end. One thing that I really couldn't ever see myself enjoying that I do now, is refactoring my old stuff when I figure out a new way to do things. Nothing I've written is really that groundbreaking, but, having things that you go back to and improve solidifies your sense of achievement and also really helps your understanding of why you thought what you did previously and then focus on what you should learn next. Having good friends who can give you much needed harsh critiques is also good on this front :) The best critiques I've had, haven't really been from getting specific things working, but rather what to focus on stylistically and design wise to improve the development process.

In a similar vein, its been nice to write this blog to track my progress. On the list of things to do is just re-write the whole thing as a flask app, but other things have prio and it works for what it is.

On the LPIC side of things, I'm kind of reluctant to push ahead and complete my LPIC2 until Iâ€™m in  a new full time role that will help me practice some of the things I've been learning. With LPIC 1 this felt like less of an issue, as a lot of the things that I picked up whilst doing it I'm able to use day to day on my homelab.  Without a live setup that supports a bunch of systems and users, it feels like LPIC II might just be an exercise in memory training that I'd quickly forget. I'll see what happens job wise in the new year though.

All things considered, although this year has been a bit of drag in many ways, it has given me the opportunity to start really focusing on learning again and I feel quite lucky to have had things to focus on. Hopefully whatever happens next year, I'll be able to continue with that.
