##### A longer read on why I started this blog and some modest 'what I hope to achieve's'

Welcome, thanks for joining me. 👋
For those that are interested (I guess thats you? 😕) I wanted to take a moment to just explain why I'd bother to write what is probablly <sup>>=9000th</sup> similar blog dedicated to learning a language or some opperateing system / application.


Perhaps theres other people out there like me, who, spent quite a while in IT or came back to it after a while and found themselves outpaced or edged out as the industry inevitably evolves. Its my hope that my rough scribblings might help some one else in a similar positon learn some stuff, or perhaps Ill network with some people in a similar postion to me.

Even if its not the case - typey makey me remembery good. 

Ive had quite a bit of experiance supporting small groups of users running Linux and Microsoft stuff, but, they never really needed any automation or cloud based stuff, so Ive been in a bit of a bind getting good new work recently.


##### Fast forward to now

At the beggining of the year, I got burgled and lost a lot of IT kit, then Covid hit. This has really gimped the remaning revenue streams I had so, its time to skill up or *die trying, yo*.
I've decide to try and formalise my Linux skills by doing some LPIC qualifications 🐧 and also bring another concurrent programming language up to date with it. I chose Python 🐍, beacuse its ubiquitous and, *why not*.
I've dabbled in lots of scripting languages before, but I've never really focused on learning one well. Something I hope to change.

##### What to expect from here.

In no particular order, here are some things I'll be posting:

* Notes that I create from LPIC study guides
* Programs that I make to solve excersize problems, mostly bash.
* Python things Ive made to test myself as I follow a few books.
* Notes about things Ive stumbled upon as part of the journey. *👋 im a Ruby 💎 nab now too*

##### Thanks for reading :)
