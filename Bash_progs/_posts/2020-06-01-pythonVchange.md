[Python version changer](https://github.com/mikebdict/pythonvchange/blob/master/pythonVchange.sh)

I've been trying to up my bash game over the last few months and thought Id explain some elements of a script I created recently that changes the softlinked version of python in my */usr/bin* folder so it might be useful to some one else learning.

Ive never really played around with AWK that much before. In the past when ever I've needed to do some regex or something like that I'd use perl (or more specifically some one elses Perl that I would then basterdise ðŸ‘€). After reading up on it, I realise how powerful it is and that its greatest strong point is that so many of the considerations that you might have when useing something like perl are moot. AWK is pretty much installed everywhere, so you just dont have to worry.
