## *Disclaimer*
These notes are for my own reference, and are by no means a complete listing of whats required for the exam. The things I note down are things that I *didnt* already know (or know in sufficent detail), and felt I should catalog them.
When the study guide has stipulated distro specific exercizes I have used the relevant docker images with added programs to test things out. My host OS is either Debian buster or Ubuntu 18.04.
