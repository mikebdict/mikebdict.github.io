##### *Disclaimer*
These notes are for my own reference, and are by no means a complete listing of whats required for the exam. The things I note down are things that I *didnt* already know (or know in sufficent detail), and felt I should catalog them.
When the study guide has stipulated distro specific exercizes I have used the relevant docker images with added programs to test things out. My host OS is either Debian buster or Ubuntu 18.04.

[Types of shell](#shells)
1. Bash - Bourne again shell, replaced Bourne
2. Dash - Debian shell with no cmd line editing - faster cmd line exec
3. Korn - Like bash but with more C tools.
4. tcsh - Tenex shell ü§∑
5. z shell - An advanced shell with *themed prompts*

[readlink](#readlink) - Just outputs 1 field (just the thing linked to. Usefull for scripts)
```bash
root@Docker-centos:$ readlink /bin/sh 
bash
user@ubuntu:$ readlink /bin/sh
dash
```
['cd / pwd'](#cd)
cd on its own takes you üè† <br>
pwd - prints working directory

[type](#type)
Reveal wether a command is built into the shell or external to it. Or just the (type(ofsomething))
```bash

user@ubuntu:$ type whoami
whoami is hashed (/usr/bin/whoami)
```
