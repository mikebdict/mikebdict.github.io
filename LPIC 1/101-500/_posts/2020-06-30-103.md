## *Disclaimer*
These notes are for my own reference, and are by no means a complete listing of whats required for the exam. The things I note down are things that I *didnt* already know (or know in sufficent detail), and felt I should catalog them.
When the study guide has stipulated distro specific exercizes I have used the relevant docker images with added programs to test things out. My host OS is either Debian buster or Ubuntu 18.04.

##### Types of Shell <a name="shells"></a>

1. Bash - Bourne again shell, replaced Bourne
2. Dash - Debian shell with no cmd line editing - faster cmd line exec
3. Korn - Like bash but with more C tools.
4. tcsh - Tenex shell ü§∑
5. z shell - An advanced shell with *themed prompts*

##### readlink <a name="readlink"></a>

```bash

user@ubuntu:$ readlink /bin/sh
dash
```
##### cd_pwd <a name="cd_pwd"></a>
* cd on its own takes you üè† 
* pwd - prints working directory

##### type <a name="type"></a>
Reveal wether a command is built into the shell or external to it. Or just the (type(ofsomething))
```bash

whoami is hashed (/usr/bin/whoami)
```
