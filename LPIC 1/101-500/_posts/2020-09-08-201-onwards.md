## Some time has passed....

A few months later, and I have my LPIC 1 and the first module for my LPIC 2. \o/ I thought Id share some notes on why I stopped updateing my notes after passing the first LPIC 1 module.

##### Memory and repetition.

After actually getting some experiance with the exam format, I realised that a lot of passing the exam comes down to memory work and repetition and paying attention to the topic weights on the LPIC site.

The top section is what I ended up doing. LPIC's own rwebsite resources are actually really good, which they should really be commended for, not a lot of providers offer the same level of learning resources actually tailored to their own exams.

What I did for both modules was read the Sybex LPIC1 Study guide takeing notes and practiceing with commands that I wasnt familar with in depth. After that I spent a lot of time doing the same thing with guided exercizes on LPI's site. The key thing, (for me anyway!) was actually playing around a lot with programs in the highly weighted areas. Theres only so much you can just flat out remeber and without some context and experiance you will struggle.
When you have some backround and context though, a lot of the questions in the exam can be logically solved rather just staticly remebering something.

It was also fun to learn how to convert bianary, lol. I didnt think ID ever say that, but Id always just 'wingged' it with subnets in the past and its nice to have that skill under my belt properly finally.

##### Whats next?.

Im going to chill for a bit on my LPIC 2, although Its actually quite interesting doing the same thing with the material there. Ive been neglecting my other projects and I want to publish / finish a load of things that I have half finished to help with getting my next job.
So, for the next few weeks Ill be working on my Python / Django projects - I've missed doing that!
